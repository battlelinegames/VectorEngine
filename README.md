# VectorEngine

VectorEngine is an AssemblyScript vector rendering engine.  I designed it with the goal of making a super simple rendering engine that can be used by anyone to write WebAssembly games using AssemblyScript.  Tutorials are available on [wasmbook.com](https://wasmbook.com).  You can install VectorEngine using npm:

```
npm i vectorengine
```
